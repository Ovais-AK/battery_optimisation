# Battery Optimiser

**What is the project?**

Building a parametric battery optimisation model with an interface accessible through a web browser. The model is going to be coded in Python, using the open-source AML Pyomo for the optimisation. Users will be allowed to set parameters for their asset and see the cashflow and charge schedule over a given price curve.
